# Programming Language Selector

#### By Kirsten Opstad

#### A simple survey to determine which programming language a person should learn

## Technologies Used

* HTML 
* CSS 
* Javascript
* Bootstrap

## Description

### Objectives (MVP)

Create a Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. 
  * Include a form with a minimum of 5 survey questions.
  * Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions.
  * One branch should return one result. It shouldn't be possible to be suggested two languages at once.
  * When the user submits the survey again (for a second or third time), that previous answers are hidden, cleared, or replaced prior to showing the new result.
  * Regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.

Addt'l Requirements:
  * Does not use window methods to interact with the user. 
  * Form gathers input from the user.
  * Branching is used to determine the result.
  * Web API object properties or methods _(not including window methods for alerting, prompting, or confirming)_ are used to display the result to the user.
  * Event handler properties or event listeners are used to handle events.
  * _When the user submits the form again (for a second or third time) previous results are hidden, cleared, or replaced._
  * Variable names are descriptive of what they represent and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
  * Web page is styled using custom CSS.
  * Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
  * The promptâ€™s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

### Goals
1. Meet MVP requirements
2. Add styling to mimic Buzzfeed quizzes like [this](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lady_emerald/celebrity-preferences-guess-favorite-color-quiz)
3. Strech: Add informational snippet about each language to display with language result.
4. Stretch: Add "why" section that display with results, lending insight into the logic of why a user was given a certain language.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repo to your workspace.
* Navigate to the top level of the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

<!-- KO Ask Yourself:

[x] Do I need to run a server? 

[x] How should I set up my databases? 

[x] Is there other code this application depends on?

_{Epicodus recommends deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_ -->

## Known Bugs

* When a user submits a complete form, the quiz questions are supposed to disappear (be hidden) but functionality was lost when the "validate" portion of the business logic was implemented.
* README: gh-pages link not working.

* If you find one, please email me at kirsten.opstad@gmail.com with the subject **[_Repo Name_] Bug** and include:
